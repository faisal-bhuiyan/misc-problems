# composer-database
In this project, a fully functional C++ program was developed that implements a simple database application. This program allows a user to manage a database of composers and relevant information about them. This project was inspired by the problem proposed [here](https://developers.google.com/edu/c++/next-steps#database-project).

The features/requirements of the program include:
- The ability to add a new composer.
- The ability to rank a composer (i.e., indicate how much we like or dislike the composer's music).
- The ability to view all the composers in the database.
- The ability to view all composers by rank.

## Instructions
- From the root directory, compile and run the `interface.cpp` program along with its dependencies using the following command: `g++ composer.cpp database.cpp interface.cpp`.
- The interface provides the following options. Please follow along the text-based prompts on screen to naviate through the program.
1) Add a new composer
2) Retrieve a composer's data
3) Promote/demote a composer's rank
4) List all composers
5) List all composers by rank
0) Quit
- Alternatively, compile and run the test programs individually to learn more about the `Composer` and `Database` classes.
