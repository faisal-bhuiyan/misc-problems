# misc-problems
A C++ and Python based repository for miscellaneous proof-of-concept (POC) code. This repository is essentially a sandbox where I store first-order solutions for a mixed bag of (unrelated for the most part) problems and POC code for design of classes/breakdown of a problem. Problems were collected from various sources (references provided in individual files where appropriate), however, the solutions were all implemented by me.

## Instructions
- These scripts are mostly stand-alone, so they should be compiled and run individually. Instructions for compiling C++ source code on Linux environment can be found [here](https://www.cs.fsu.edu/~myers/howto/g++compiling.txt).
- A brief description of what the code does is provided at the top of each file. READMEs are added for larger projects where appropriate.
