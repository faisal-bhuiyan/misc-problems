# misc-problems
A C++ repository for miscellaneous proof of concept code. This repository is basically a sandbox where I store the first-order solutions for a mixed bag of (unrelated) problems and proof-of-concept code for some classes/objects.

## Instructions
- These scripts are all stand-alone, so they should be compiled and run individually.
- A brief description of what the code does is provided at the top of each file.
